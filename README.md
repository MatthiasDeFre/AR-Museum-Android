# AR Museum Application

This application was made for my bachelor thesis. The point of the application is to allow museums to use augmented reality to make museum visits more interactive. The museums would have access to a frontend were they would be able to create quizzes and tours. When visitors download the application they have the ability to select the different tours from the museum. After a tour a select the visitor will be shown a hint of where they need to go, upon reaching the painting they will be given a riddle that they need to solve. After solving the riddle they'll be shown a hint for the next painting etc..
